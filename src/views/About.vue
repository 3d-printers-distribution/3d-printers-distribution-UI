      <p class="title"><b> 3DtoMeds </b> - <span class="font-weight-light">Delivering the 3D printing community power to fight COVID19</span></p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-medium">
          3DtoMeds was born out of the realisation that medical centers throughout Europe
          are facing a very severe scarcity of personal protective equipment to fight the coronavirus crisis.
        </span>
          <br>
          Our team is united by a common vision: to design an efficient platform to urgently connect the 3D
          printing community to the closest medical centers in need and to ensure fast and reliable delivery.
          <br><br>
          <span class="font-italic">“Our first priority right now needs to be maximising the availability of personal protective
          equipment in Europe, especially masks and medical devices such as ventilators,” </span> 
          <br>-- Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services - The Financial Times, March 20th 2020
          <br><br>
          We are convinced that unlocking the production power of the 3D printing community will make a difference in the COVID19 crisis but ultimately with most of the european population in confinement today, delivery is critical.
          <br>
          Our platform connects pharmacies and medical centers that are in need of personal protective equipment and medical devices with 3D printers and delivery men in their neighbourhood.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical centers and pharmacies will have a clear view on the available stocks of personal protective equipment around them</li>
          <li>All available 3D printers equipped will be able to make themselves visible to accelerate the production of qualified 3D printed parts, where they’re needed, when they’re needed.</li>
          <li>Supply Chain will be shortened and delivery made faster. Delivery men, professional, volunteers and civil servant will be recruited to join the movement</li>
        </ul>
