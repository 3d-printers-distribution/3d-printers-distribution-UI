      <br>
      Delivering the 3D printing community power to fight COVID19
      <br>
      3DtoMeds was born out of the realisation that medical centers throughout Europe
      are facing a very severe scarcity of personal protective equipment to fight the coronavirus crisis.
      <br>
      Our team is united by a common vision: to design an efficient platform to urgently connect the 3D
      printing community to the closest medical centers in need and to ensure fast and reliable delivery.
      <br>
      “Our first priority right now needs to be maximising the availability of personal protective
      equipment in Europe, especially masks and medical devices such as ventilators,”
      Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services - The Financial Times,
      MARCH 20th 2020
      <br>
      We are convinced that unlocking the production power of the 3D printing community will make a difference in the COVID19 crisis but ultimately with most of the european population in confinement today, delivery is critical.
      <br>
      Our platform connects pharmacies and medical centers that are in need of personal protective equipment and medical devices with 3D printers and delivery men in their neighbourhood.
      <br>
      Medical centers and pharmacies will have a clear view on the available stocks of personal protective equipment around them
      <br>
      All available 3D printers equipped will be able to make themselves visible to accelerate the production of qualified 3D printed parts, where they’re needed, when they’re needed.
      <br>
      Supply Chain will be shortened and delivery made faster. Delivery men, professional, volunteers and civil servant will be recruited to join the movement
